# Apple Design

How Apple builds interfaces that stop feeling like a computer and start feeling like an extension of you. This knowledge comes from Apple's WWDC design talks — chiefly *Designing Fluid Interfaces* (WWDC 2018) — distilled and translated into the web platform (CSS, Pointer Events, `requestAnimationFrame`, spring libraries like Motion/Framer Motion).

The through-line: **an interface feels alive when motion starts from the current on-screen value, inherits the user's velocity, projects momentum forward, and can be grabbed and reversed at any instant.** Springs are the tool that makes all of this natural, because they are inherently interruptible and velocity-aware.

## The Core Idea

> "When we align the interface to the way we think and move, something magical happens — it stops feeling like a computer and starts feeling like a seamless extension of us."

An interface is fluid when it behaves like the physical world: things respond instantly, move continuously, carry momentum, resist at boundaries, and can be redirected mid-motion. Everything below is a way to get closer to that.

Apple frames design as serving four human needs: **safety/predictability, understanding, achievement, and joy.** Every rule here serves one of them.

## 1. Response — kill latency

The moment lag appears, the feeling of directness "falls off a cliff." Response is the foundation everything else is built on.

- **Respond on pointer-down, not on release.** Highlight a button the instant it's pressed. Waiting for `click`/touch-up to show feedback feels dead.
- **Be vigilant about every latency.** Audit debounces, artificial timers, transition waits, and the ~300ms tap delay. Anything on the input path that isn't essential is a regression.
- **Feedback must be continuous *during* the interaction, not just at the end.** For a drag, slider, or drawer, update the UI 1:1 with the pointer the whole way through — never animate only when the gesture completes.

```css
/* Feedback lives on the press, and it's instant */
.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  transition: transform 100ms ease-out;
}
```

## 2. Direct manipulation — 1:1 tracking

> "Touch and content should move together."

When the user drags something, it must stay glued to the finger — and respect the offset from *where they grabbed it*. Snapping to the element's center on grab breaks the illusion immediately.

- Use Pointer Events with `setPointerCapture` so tracking continues even when the pointer leaves the element's bounds.
- Track a short **velocity/position history** (last few `pointermove` events), not just the current point — you'll need velocity at release.

```js
el.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e) => {
  el.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId);
  const grabOffset = e.clientY - el.getBoundingClientRect().top; // respect where they grabbed
  // ...track position + timestamp history for velocity
});
```

## 3. Interruptibility — the single most important principle

> "The thought and the gesture happen in parallel."

Every animation must be interruptible and redirectable at any moment. A user must be able to grab a moving element mid-flight and reverse it without waiting for the animation to finish. A closing modal the user grabs again should follow the finger — not finish closing first, then reopen.

- **Never lock out input during a transition.**
- **Always animate from the *presentation* (current) value, never the target value.** On interrupt, read the element's live on-screen transform and start the new animation from there. Starting from the logical/target value causes a visible jump.
- **Avoid CSS transitions and `@keyframes` for anything gesture-driven** — they can't be smoothly grabbed and reversed mid-flight. Springs animate from the current value by default, which is exactly what interruption needs.
- **When a gesture reverses, blend velocity — don't hard-cut it.** Replacing one animation with another at a reversal creates a velocity discontinuity, a "brick wall." Spring libraries that carry velocity through a re-target avoid it. (This is what iOS's *additive animations* do natively; on the web, choose a spring library that re-targets from the current velocity.)
- **Decompose 2D motion into independent X and Y springs.** A single spring on a 2D distance desyncs when X and Y have different velocities.

## 4. Behavior over animation — use springs

> "Think of animation as a conversation between you and the object, not something prescribed by the interface."

A pre-scripted, fixed-duration animation can't respond to new input. A spring can — new input just changes the target, and the motion stays continuous. Reach for springs for anything a user can touch.

Apple deliberately replaced the physics triplet (mass/stiffness/damping) with two designer-friendly parameters. Think in these:

- **Damping ratio** — controls overshoot. `1.0` = critically damped, no bounce, smooth settle. `< 1.0` = overshoots and oscillates. Lower = bouncier.
- **Response** — how quickly the value reaches the target, in seconds. Lower = snappier. **This is not "duration"** — a spring has no fixed duration; its settle time emerges from the parameters.

**Defaults:**
- Start most UI at **damping `1.0`** (critically damped) — graceful and non-distracting.
- Add bounce (**damping ~`0.8`**) **only when the gesture itself carried momentum** (a flick, a throw, a drag release). Overshoot on a menu that just faded in feels wrong; overshoot on a card you flicked feels right.

**Concrete values Apple ships:**

| Interaction | Damping | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move / reposition (e.g. PiP) | `1.0` | `0.4` |
| Rotation | `0.8` | `0.4` |
| Drawer / sheet | `0.8` | `0.3` |

**Web mapping (Motion / Framer Motion):** the `bounce` + `duration` spring API maps closely to Apple's damping + response. A safe house style is `damping: 1.0` springs everywhere by default; reserve bounce for momentum-driven, physical interactions.

```js
import { animate } from 'motion';

// Critically damped default (no overshoot)
animate(el, { y: 0 }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 });

// Momentum interaction — a little bounce, only because a flick preceded it
animate(el, { y: target }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0.2, duration: 0.4 });
```

## 5. Velocity handoff — the seam between drag and animation

When a gesture ends, the animation must **continue at the finger's exact velocity**, so there's no visible seam between dragging and animating. This is the detail that most separates "fluid" from "fine."

Pass the pointer's release velocity as the spring's initial velocity. Some spring APIs want **relative** velocity — normalize it by the remaining distance to the target:

```
relativeVelocity = gestureVelocity / (targetValue − currentValue)
```

Example: element at `y=50`, target `y=150` (100px to go), finger moving 50px/s → initial spring velocity = `50 / 100 = 0.5`. Framer Motion / Motion take absolute px/s velocity directly (`velocity` option), so you usually hand it the raw value.

## 6. Momentum projection — animate to where the gesture is *going*

> "Take a small input and make a big output."

Don't snap to the nearest boundary from the *release point*. Use velocity to **project the resting position** — exactly like scroll deceleration — then snap to the target nearest that projected point. This is what makes a flick feel like it throws the element.

Apple's exact projection function (from the *Designing Fluid Interfaces* sample code):

```js
// decelerationRate ≈ 0.998 for normal scroll feel; 0.99 for snappier
function project(initialVelocity /* px/s */, decelerationRate = 0.998) {
  return (initialVelocity / 1000) * decelerationRate / (1 - decelerationRate);
}

const projectedEndpoint = currentPosition + project(releaseVelocity);
const target = nearestSnapPoint(projectedEndpoint);   // choose target from the projection
animateSpringTo(target, { velocity: releaseVelocity }); // then hand off velocity (§5)
```

Note: the physics-textbook `v²/(2·decel)` is *not* what Apple ships — use the exponential-decay form above. This is the standard behavior in good bottom-sheets and carousels (Vaul, Embla).

## 17. Process

- **Prototype interactively — an interactive demo is worth "a million static designs."** You discover the interface by building and playing with it; a working prototype also sets a concrete bar that prevents a mediocre final implementation.
- **Design interaction and visuals together.** "You shouldn't be able to tell where one ends and the other begins." Motion is not a layer added after the pixels.
- **Test with real people in real context**, and review motion with fresh eyes — play it in slow motion / frame-by-frame to catch what's invisible at full speed.

| Gesture → spring velocity | Hand off release velocity | `gestureVelocity / (target − current)` if normalized |
| Flick landing point | Project momentum | `current + (v/1000)·d/(1−d)`, `d ≈ 0.998` |
| Interrupt cleanly | Start from presentation (live) value | read the on-screen transform |
| Avoid reversal "brick wall" | Carry velocity through re-target | spring that blends velocity |
| Reversible transition | Mirror the easing curve | inverse cubic-bézier |
| Decide reverse vs. commit | Use velocity **sign**, not position | at release |
| 1:1 drag | Pointer Events + capture | respect the grab offset |
| Feedback | On pointer-down, continuous | never only at the end |
| Boundary | Rubber-band, don't hard-stop | progressive resistance |
| Translucent chrome | `backdrop-filter` layer | content scrolls under |
| Type tracking | Size-specific, never fixed | tighten large text (`-0.02em`), body near `0` |
| Reduced motion | Cross-fade, not slide/spring | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` |
