## 4. Universal Anti-patterns

These mark "AI slop" schematics of any type:

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Dark mode + cyan/purple glow | Looks "technical" without design decisions |
| JetBrains Mono as blanket "dev" font | Mono is for *technical* content — ports, commands, URLs. Names go in Geist sans. |
| Identical boxes for every node | Erases hierarchy |
| Legend floating inside the diagram area | Collides with nodes |
| Arrow labels with no masking rect | Bleeds through the line |
| Vertical `writing-mode` text on arrows | Unreadable |
| 3 equal-width summary cards as default | Generic grid — vary widths |
| Shadow on any element | Shadows are out. Borders are in. |
| `rounded-2xl` on boxes | Max radius 6–10px or none |
| Coral on every "important" node | Coral is 1–2 editorial accents, not a signaling system |
| Reproducing Mermaid's renderer layout | Imports automatic spacing and routing instead of making an editorial layout |
| Any breach of the six §6 connector rules | Diagonal slants, labels touching their stroke, masks clipped by a later node, overlapping paths, shared attach points, transit behind a non-endpoint box — each is an automatic fail; §6 states them in full |

Type-specific anti-patterns live in each type reference linked in the guide.

## 5. Design System

**The design system is skinnable.** All colors, typography, and tokens live in a single source of truth — [`references/style-guide.md`](references/style-guide.md). This file describes semantic roles (`paper`, `ink`, `muted`, `accent`, `link`, …). The default skin is a cool editorial palette (white-smoke paper, jet-black ink, atomic-tangerine accent, blue-slate muted, silver hairlines); to apply your own brand, either edit `style-guide.md` directly or run the URL-based flow described in [`references/onboarding.md`](references/onboarding.md).

> When specs below or in type references mention "ink", "accent", "muted", etc., look up the current hex value in `style-guide.md`.

### Semantic roles (at a glance)

| Role | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `paper`, `paper-2` | Page bg and container bg |
| `ink` | Primary text / stroke |
| `muted`, `soft` | Secondary text, default arrows, sublabels |
| `rule`, `rule-solid` | Hairline borders |
| `accent`, `accent-tint` | 1–2 focal elements per diagram |
| `link` | HTTP/API calls, external arrows |

**Focal rule:** `accent` goes on 1–2 elements max. Everything else is `ink` / `muted` / `soft`. If you're tempted to accent 4 things, you haven't decided what's focal yet.

### Node type → treatment

| Type | Fill | Stroke |
|---|---|---|
| **Focal** (1–2 max) | `accent-tint` | `accent` |
| **Backend / API / Step** | white | `ink` |
| **Store / State** | `ink @ 0.05` | `muted` |
| **External / Cloud** | `ink @ 0.03` | `ink @ 0.30` |
| **Input / User** | `muted @ 0.10` | `soft` |
| **Optional / Async** | `ink @ 0.02` | `ink @ 0.20` dashed `4,3` |
| **Security / Boundary** | `accent @ 0.05` | `accent @ 0.50` dashed `4,4` |

### Typography (summary — full spec in style-guide.md)

- **Title** — Instrument Serif, 1.75rem, 400 — H1 only
- **Node name** — Geist (sans), 12px, 600 — human-readable labels
- **Sublabel** — Geist Mono, 9px — ports, URLs, field types
- **Eyebrow / tag** — Geist Mono, 7–8px, uppercase, tracked — type tags, axis labels
- **Arrow label** — Geist Mono, 8px — annotation on arrows
- **Editorial aside** — Instrument Serif *italic*, 14px — callouts only

**Mono is for technical content only** — never as a blanket "dev" font, and never JetBrains Mono.
